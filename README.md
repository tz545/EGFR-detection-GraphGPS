# Finetuning GraphGPS-deep for predicting EGFR-activity

Please see the [report](https://github.com/tz545/EGFR-detection-GraphGPS/blob/main/notebooks/project_report.ipynb) in Jupyter notebbok format. It describes the three stages of the project in full:

1. Data exploration  
1. Establishing a performance baseline  
1. Finetuning the GraphGPS model for EGFR potency prediction
